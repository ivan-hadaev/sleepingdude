    <h2>What data is being collected</h2>
    <p>
      The extension uses Google Analytics to track its installs and usage. A
      single pageview is tracked every time the extension&#39;s background
      script is executed. That means one pageview for each browser session (the
      whole time the browser is running), regardless of the amount of scrobbled
      songs or supported websites visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the extension requests permission to access all browsed pages, it
      does that only for convenience of future development - users will not be
      prompted to confirm access to every single website supported by the
      extension. It also opens up a possibility of supporting embedded players.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension does not track visits of any particular pages. It also does
      not access your personal data on any of supported websites. Nor does it
      interfere with any page&#39;s contents.
    </p>
    <h2>How the data is being used</h2>
    <p>
      The data collected by Google Analytics is used to track usage of the
      extension in time and across various browsers and their versions. The data
      can be used for strategic decisions regarding the extension&#39;s
      development and marketing.
